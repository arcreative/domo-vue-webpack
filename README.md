## Documentation

- [For this template](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack): common questions specific to this template are answered and each part is described in greater detail
- [For Vue 2.0](http://vuejs.org/guide/): general information about how to work with Vue, not specific to this template

## Prerequisites

- Vue-CLI (install with `npm install -g vue-cli`)
- Domo CLI (install with `npm install -g ryuu`)

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init webpack my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ domo login $    # Required if a session is not currently active
$ npm run publish # Required at least once to pull data in development
$ npm run dev
```

If port 8080 is already in use on your machine you must change the port number in `/config/index.js`. Otherwise `npm run dev` will fail.
